This is an application designed to shorten Urls

To run please run:
gradlew clean build
gradlew bootRun

Then in another terminal:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/shorten -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"url\":\"https://www.originenergy.com.au/electricity-gas/plans.html\"}"\
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/shorten -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"url\":\"https://www.google.com\"}"\
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/shorten -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"url\":\"https://www.example.com\"}"\

These 3 commands will hit our application's endpoint generating a unique nonsequential url that will redirect to the corresponding url.

Another end point that is exposed is the "baseUrl"/info/{code} endpoint. Calling this endpoint with a code generated previously will display information
Such as what time it was created at and the original url for the new short url.

Error Handling:
Make sure it return if bad url

Write ways to scale
ie, use load balancer and multiple servers
use redis cache to get quicker look ups


TODO write unit tests
